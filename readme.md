Data Source
We initially generate our data using `generate_data.py`
Users can add their own data by interacting with the command line app

Setup Instructions
```
chmod +x setup.sh
bash setup.sh
```

Running the APp
Run `python3 app.py`

CSV files are written under `data`. You may need to run `mkdir data`

> If there are any unfinished features, indicate this in your README so that we know some incomplete functionality is intended to prevent possible deductions (assuming you follow the rest of the requirements)
