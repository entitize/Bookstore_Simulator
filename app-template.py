This is a template you may start with for your Final Project application.
You may choose to modify it, or you may start with the example function
stubs (most of which are incomplete). An example is also posted
from Lecture 19 on Canvas.

For full credit, remove any irrelevant comments, which are included in the
template to help you get started. Replace this program overview with a
brief overview of your application as well (including your name/partners name).

Some sections are provided as recommended program breakdowns, but are optional
to keep, and you will probably want to extend them based on your application's
features.
